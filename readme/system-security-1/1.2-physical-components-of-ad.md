# 1.2 - Physical Components of Active Directory

## **Domain Controller (DC)**

\
The Domain Controller (DC) is the backbone of an Active Directory environment, ensuring seamless network operations by managing authentication, authorization, and directory services.

### **Functions**:

* **Hosts AD DS Directory Store**:\
  The DC maintains a full copy of the Active Directory database (`Ntds.dit`), which stores vital data about users, groups, policies, and more. This centralized repository ensures data consistency and supports resource management.
* **Authentication & Authorization**:\
  DCs verify the identity of users and devices attempting to access network resources. They evaluate credentials and enforce access permissions based on security policies, enabling single sign-on (SSO) functionality across resources.
* **Replication**:\
  Active Directory employs a multi-master replication model where changes on one DC are replicated to others, ensuring data consistency across the domain. This mechanism minimizes downtime and maintains service availability.
* **Administrative Access**:\
  DCs allow administrators to manage the directory, including creating user accounts, applying Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and configuring permissions. These operations ensure that the network runs securely and efficiently.

### **Security Considerations**:

* **Risks of Compromise**:
  * Unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
  * Theft or tampering with directory data.
  * Potential propagation of malware or further attacks.
* **Mitigation Strategies**:
  * Deploy redundant DCs to enhance fault tolerance.
  * Implement monitoring systems for unusual activity.
  * Regularly audit configurations and permissions.
* **Resilience in Large Environments**:
  * Multiple DCs distribute workloads and prevent a single point of failure.
  * Global catalog servers enhance query performance across forests.

## **AD DS Data Store**

The AD DS Data Store, represented by the `Ntds.dit` file, is the heart of the Active Directory system. It securely stores all directory-related data, ensuring reliable operations and resource management.

### **Key Features**:

* **Data Storage**:
  * Stores objects like user accounts, groups, organizational units, and attributes.
  * Includes sensitive information, such as password hashes (encrypted).
* **Access Control**:\
  Only authorized domain controller processes can interact with the data store. Attempts to access the file directly are logged and restricted.
* **Replication**:\
  Changes made to the data are propagated across all domain controllers in a domain, ensuring consistency and redundancy.
* **Location**:\
  By default, the `Ntds.dit` file resides in `%SystemRoot%\NTDS`.

**Importance in AD Operations**:

* Essential for user authentication and resource allocation.
* Serves as the central point for enforcing directory-wide policies.
