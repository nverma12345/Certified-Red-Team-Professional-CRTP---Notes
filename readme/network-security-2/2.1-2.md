A **trust** is a relationship between two domains or forests that allows users from one domain or forest to access resources in another.\
Trusts can be either **automatic** (such as parent-child trusts within the same forest) or **manually established** (such as external or forest trusts).

**Trusted Domain Objects (TDOs)** are used to represent these trust relationships within a domain.

### Trust Direction

* **One-Way Trust**:\
  A unidirectional relationship where users in the _trusted domain_ can access resources in the _trusting domain_, but not the other way around.
* **Two-Way Trust**:\
  A bidirectional relationship where users from both domains can access resources in each other's domains.

### Trust Transitivity

* **Transitive Trusts**:\
  These can be extended to establish trust with additional domains.\
  All default intra-forest trusts (such as tree-root and parent-child) are **two-way transitive trusts**.
* **Non-Transitive Trusts**:\
  These trusts **cannot** be extended to other domains. They can either be one-way or two-way.\
  Non-transitive trusts are typically created between two domains in different forests (known as _external trusts_).

***

### Default (Automatic) Trusts

* **Parent-Child Trust**:\
  Created automatically when a new domain is added under an existing domain in the namespace hierarchy.\
  Example: `dollarcorp.moneycorp.local` is a child domain of `moneycorp.local`.\
  Always **two-way** and **transitive**.
* **Tree-Root Trust**:\
  Created automatically when a new domain tree is added to a forest.\
  Always **two-way** and **transitive**.

### External Trusts

* Established between **two domains in different forests** when the forests themselves do not have a trust relationship.
* Can be **one-way** or **two-way**.
* Always **non-transitive**.

### Forest Trusts

* Created between the **root domains** of two forests.
* Cannot be automatically extended to additional forests (i.e., no implicit transitive trust with a third forest).
* Can be either **one-way** or **two-way**, and are **transitive** within the connected forests.

## Domain Trust Enumeration

To enumerate domain trusts:

```powershell
# List all domain trusts for the current domain
Get-DomainTrust

# List trusts for a specific domain
Get-DomainTrust -Domain us.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local

# Using Active Directory module
Get-ADTrust
Get-ADTrust -Identity us.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local
```

***

## Forest Enumeration

To map information about the forest:

```powershell
# Get details about the current forest
Get-Forest
Get-Forest -Forest eurocorp.local

# Using Active Directory module
Get-ADForest
Get-ADForest -Identity eurocorp.local
```

Retrieve all domains in the current forest:

```powershell
Get-ForestDomain
Get-ForestDomain -Forest eurocorp.local

(Get-ADForest).Domains
```

Retrieve all global catalogs for the forest:

```powershell
Get-ForestGlobalCatalog
Get-ForestGlobalCatalog -Forest eurocorp.local

Get-ADForest | Select-Object -ExpandProperty GlobalCatalogs
```

Map forest trust relationships (if any exist):

```powershell
Get-ForestTrust
Get-ForestTrust -Forest eurocorp.local

# Alternative using Active Directory module
Get-ADTrust -Filter 'msDS-TrustForestTrustInfo -ne "$null"'
```
