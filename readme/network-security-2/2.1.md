# 4.1 - Access Control (ACL/ACE)

## Access Control List (ACL)

An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a collection of rules that specify access permissions for an object in Active Directory. Every AD object (users, groups, organizational units, shared resources, etc.) has an associated ACL that determines who can access it and what operations they can perform.

There are two main types of ACLs:

* **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)** – Defines which users or groups are allowed or denied access.
* **System Access Control List (SACL)** – Used for auditing access attempts.

#### Example: Viewing ACLs in PowerShell

To view the ACL of an AD object, you can use PowerShell:

```powershell
$object = Get-ADUser -Identity "JohnDoe"
(Get-Acl -Path "AD:$($object.DistinguishedName)").Access
```

This command retrieves the ACL entries for the user **JohnDoe**.

## Access Control Entity (ACE)

An **Access Control Entry (ACE)** is an individual rule within an ACL that defines specific permissions granted or denied to a user or group.

Each ACE includes:

* The **Security Principal** (user, group, or computer to which permissions apply).
* The **Access Mask** (specific permissions such as read, write, delete, etc.).
* The **Access Type** (Allow or Deny).

#### Example: Understanding ACEs

An ACE might specify that:

* User **Alice** has **Full Control** over an Organizational Unit (OU).
* Group **HelpDesk** has **Read and Write** permissions to modify certain user attributes.
* User **Bob** is **explicitly denied** the ability to delete an object.

## Managing ACLs and ACEs in Active Directory

Administrators can modify ACLs and ACEs using graphical tools like **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)** or command-line tools like PowerShell.

#### Viewing ACLs in GUI

1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers** (ADUC).
2. Enable **Advanced Features** (View > Advanced Features).
3. Right-click an object and go to **Properties > Security tab**.

#### Modifying ACLs Using PowerShell

To add an ACE granting a user full control over an object:

```powershell
$acl = Get-Acl "AD:CN=JohnDoe,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com"
$identity = New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount("example.com\Alice")
$permission = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryRights]::GenericAll
$accessRule = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryAccessRule($identity, $permission, "Allow")
$acl.AddAccessRule($accessRule)
Set-Acl -Path "AD:CN=JohnDoe,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com" -AclObject $acl
```

This script grants **Alice** full control over the user **JohnDoe**.

### Best Practices for Managing ACLs and ACEs

1. **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** – Assign only the necessary permissions to users and groups.
2. **Use Groups Instead of Individual Users** – Assign permissions to security groups instead of specific users to simplify management.
3. **Monitor and Audit ACL Changes** – Regularly review ACLs and configure SACLs to track changes and access attempts.
4. **Avoid Explicit Deny ACEs** – Use **Allow** rules whenever possible, as **Deny** rules override all allow permissions.
5. **Regularly Review ACLs** – Periodically check permissions to remove unnecessary access and improve security.

## Enumerate ACL/ACE using PowerView

*   **Get the ACLs associated with the specified object**

    ```powershell
    Get-DomainObjectAcl -SamAccountName student1 -ResolveGUIDs
    ```
*   **Get the ACLs associated with the specified prefix to be used for search**

    ```powershell
    Get-DomainObjectAcl -SearchBase "LDAP://CN=DomainAdmins,CN=Users,DC=dollarcorp,DC=moneycorp,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs -Verbose
    ```
*   **Get the ACLs associated for Domain Admins**

    ```powershell
    Get-DomainObjectAcl -Identity "Domain Admins" -ResolveGUIDs -Verbose
    ```
*   **Analyze Trust Relationships (**&#x44;isplays trust relationships between domains)

    ```powershell
    Get-NetDomainTrust
    ```
*   **Check ACLs on AD Objects** (Shows ACLs for a specific user account, resolving GUIDs to human-readable names)

    ```powershell
    Get-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName "Administrator" -ResolveGUIDs
    ```
*   **Search for interesting ACEs**

    ```powershell
    Find-InterestingDomainAcl -ResolveGUIDs
    ```
*   #### Get ACLs where studentx has interesting permissions

    ```powershell
    Find-InterestingDomainAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReferenceName -match "student867"}
    ```
*   **Get the ACLs associated with the specified path**

    ```powershell
    Get-PathAcl -Path "\\dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local\sysvol"
    ```

Another good way is using BloodHound.
