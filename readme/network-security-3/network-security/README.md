# 5.1 - Privilege Escalation

## Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation is usually the third step (after Reconnaissance and Domain Enumeration) regarding attack methodology.

In an AD environment we can perform privilege escalation for this scope:

* Hunting for Local Admin access on other machines
* Hunting for high privilege domain account (like as DOmain Administrator).

There're various ways to escalate privileges on Windows Box:

* Missing patches
* Feature Abuse
* Automated deployment and AutoLogon psw in cleartext
* AlwaysInstallElevated (Any user can run MSI as SYSTEM)
* Misconfigured Services
* DLL Hijacking and more
* Unquoted Service Path
* Scheduled Task
* Kerberos and NTLM Relaying
