* Modify Group Policy
* Grant Rights (Generic All)
* Grant Ownership

A GPO with overly permissive ACL can be abused for multiple attacks (attacks flagged are present into course):

In this case we're focusing on: **Add Local Admin** and **Modify Group Policy**.

### GPOddity

GPOddity combines NTLM relaying and modification of Group Policy Container.

By relaying credentials of a user who has WriteDACL on GPO, we can modify the path (gPCFileSysPath) of the Group Policy Template (default is SYSVOL).

Using this, we can load malicious template from a location controller by attacker.
