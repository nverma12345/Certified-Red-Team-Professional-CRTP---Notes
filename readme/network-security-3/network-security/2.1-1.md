# 5.1.2 - Relaying

## Relaying

In a relaying attack, the target credentials are not captured directly, but they're forwarded to a local or remote service or an endpoint for authentication.

Two types based on authentication are:

* NTLM Relaying
* Kerberos Relaying

and the two most abused services for relaying are LDAP and AD CS.

In this HomeMade Labs is displayed the Net-NTLM relay attack tecnique:
